# Task Manager API (In-Memory)

This is a simple Task Manager REST API built using Express.js. It supports basic CRUD operations and additional features like filtering, sorting, and priority-based retrieval. All data is stored in-memory, so changes are lost on server restart.

- Create a new task
- Retrieve all tasks or a specific task by ID
- Update a task by ID
- Delete a task by ID
